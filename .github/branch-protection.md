## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Status checks must be enabled** for the automated workflows to work properly
- **Branch protection rules** ensure code quality standards are maintained
- **Required reviewers** can be added based on your team structure
- **Automated workflows** will provide feedback on PRs automatically

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize these rules based on your team's needs:

- Adjust the number of required approvals
